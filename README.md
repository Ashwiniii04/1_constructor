# Fantasy Character Constructor (C++)

This project demonstrates the concept of **constructors** in C++ using a simple fantasy-themed example.  
It defines a `character` class that stores and displays details like the character’s name, age, race, height, and attack power.



 # Project Overview

- Uses **object-oriented programming (OOP)** concepts  
- Demonstrates **default and parameterized constructors**  
- Displays multiple attributes of a fantasy character  
- Beginner-friendly example to understand C++ class initialization
  

# Tech Stack


-Language: C++

-Compiler: Any standard C++ compiler 


# Concepts Covered

-Constructor: 


-Special member functions that are automatically called when an object is created. They are used to initialize the object’s data members.
Object Initialization: How memory for an object is set up and its initial values are assigned.


#  How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ashwiniii04/1_constructor


# Acknowledgments
-This example is based on fundamental C++ programming concepts.
