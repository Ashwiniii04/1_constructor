C++ Constructor Example
A clear and concise C++ code example demonstrating fundamental constructor concepts.
Overview
This repository contains a simple C++ program (constructor1.cpp) designed to illustrate the core principles and various types of constructors in C++. It serves as an educational example for understanding how objects are initialized when they are created, covering essential constructor functionalities.
Concepts Covered
Constructors: Special member functions that are automatically called when an object is created. They are used to initialize the object’s data members.
Object Initialization: How memory for an object is set up and its initial values are assigned.
Tech Stack
Language: C++
Compiler: Any standard C++ compiler 
Quick Start
To compile and run this C++ example, you’ll need a C++ compiler installed on your system.
Prerequisites
A C++ compile
Acknowledgments
This example is based on fundamental C++ programming concepts.
